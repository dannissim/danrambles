What to dream of? I don’t know what I want. All I know is what makes me happy right now. Which is spending time with my beloved, listening to music, and perhaps solving problems. Knowing to improvise with the keyboard is a lifelong wonderful skill.

We are able to discretisize ideas and thoughts into words. Although there are finite many words, there are uncountable many ways to express yourself. The tone of your voice, the speed, perhaps in other words the music you produce with your mouth every day. Music is uncountable. This argues that it should not be too hard to produce music of your own. The face you make when talking is another aspect as well.

Why do I enjoy listening to music? I’m not interested in the biology of the question, but the meaning of joy. Why is joy interesting to me? Why do I possess curious thoughts at all?...
What am I doing here (in this world)? Right now I’m studying theories people from many generations ago gave their lives for developing. It is very interesting and the theories are never ending, giving busy work to people who want to learn, which takes an amount of time as large as they would like.
Why do we have the need to keep our curious minds busy and satisfied? These may be somewhat dangerous questions as they might be the ones that lead to people giving up on a “normal life” and stop investing in their own development. This is the reason I’ve skipped pondering these questions. Now, I don’t know what makes a question important, but these ones keep popping up in my mind, and I am not one to ignore my own thoughts.
Many of the things we learn are somewhat shallow and are trivial consequences from a mature understanding of the (definitions of the) concepts which are talked about.
I am interested in the surprising mind-opening consequences, in the “deep understanding” of things.
I feel I have not reached the stage of “deep understanding” in any aspect of life. However I feel like I am developing gradually what I called a mature understanding of some of the aspects included in life.
When thinking about these ideas, I thought of a very intuitive idea which is what old people that have lived full lives, think about what i call a “deep understanding” of something, and my impression is that this is not an idea that is given very much concern or importance, a frustrating impression to say the least. This reinforces the well known statement that I will only receive these answers as time passes and my mind matures. Whatever let’s try to figure it out now anyways because this does not satisfy me.

I feel like asking questions and not answering them is a waste of time at my stage of life (asking without and idea or any intention in finding a satisfiable answer). Something very interesting to me is the channel in which we express thoughts, ideas, emotions. In my eyes emotions are multi-dimensional concepts which no sequence of words can define. Despite this, a specific special look in to a peer’s eye, has the capacity of giving so much information (which again, cannot be represented by any word). How is this possible? Effects similar to this can be seen all of the time. For example, emotions, are passed with music, and ideas can be passed with a movie (again, these emotions and ideas cannot be expressed with words). Perhaps this means that we share a hidden language. How would one go about characterizing this hidden language? We must be able to say something substantial about it, I am unable to right now.
