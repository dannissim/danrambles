How do I envision the perfect society? Well, the topic suggests that such a thing exists, and therefore I shall write under that assumption.

First off, I would like to stress that this a conceptual writing, rather than a description of
implementational or executional principles. This means that I will express high-level ideas that
encapsulate my view of a perfect society. A simple example for the difference between concept and
implementation can come from the Data Structure field, in which we first discuss the abstract needs and characteristics of a type of data structure and only afterwards discuss how to actually store data into the computer’s memory.

In our world today, we can largely differentiate all professions into two categories: maintenance jobs and development jobs, where currently maintenance jobs hold the vast majority. A maintenance job is on that keeps the world’s state the way it is. These jobs are essential for our survival as without them our day to day needs will no longer be available. However, in my view of the perfect society, no human will ever perform a maintenance job, and we are slowly getting there, mostly with the use of robots and automation. This will leave the whole of the human population doing development jobs. These are jobs that don’t fit the traditional meaning of the word “job”. They aren’t essential for our physical survival, but they are for our spiritual fulfillment, and for our need to express our individual creativity, in all its forms. These jobs are still challenging and are still filled with failure, allowing us to preserve our appreciation towards success. They allow us to live passion driven lives.

Of course, with such a view several problems come to mind. One of them is that I and probably no
one could ever predict if such a world is free of wars or tragedies. Second is the question whether the need for maintenance will ever end. This arises because of the evolving “needs” for each generation. For example, most of our parents or grandparents very much didn’t “need” a room for themselves, but today it is very common. This means that maybe with development comes more
need for maintenance, never allowing us to reach the state described above.

In conclusion, a perfect society is an immensely complex concept. One that is tough to describe and probably impossible to prove its actual perfection, but with the exposure to more ideas appears the path that brings us closer and closer.
